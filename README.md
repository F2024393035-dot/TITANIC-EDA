# Titanic - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset to uncover insights into passenger survival rates based on features like age, gender, passenger class, and more.
## 📌 Objective
To analyze and visualize the Titanic dataset to identify patterns and relationships between various features and the survival outcome. The goal is to understand:
- Which groups of people were more likely to survive
- How variables like gender, age, and class impacted survival
## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook
## 📊 Key Steps in the Analysis
1. **Data Loading & Inspection**  
   - Loaded the dataset and explored data types, shapes, and missing values.
2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handled missing values (e.g., Age, Cabin, Embarked).
   - Dropped or imputed missing data where necessary.
3. **Univariate Analysis**  
   - Studied individual variables like Age, Sex, Pclass, Fare, and Survived.
   - Visualized distributions using histograms and bar plots.
4. **Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis**  
   - Explored relationships between features and survival using:
     - Count plots
     - Box plots
     - Heatmaps (correlation)
   - Noted strong influence of Sex and Pclass on survival.
5. **Insights Derived**  
   - Women had a much higher survival rate than men.
   - Passengers in 1st class were more likely to survive.
   - Younger passengers had better survival chances.
